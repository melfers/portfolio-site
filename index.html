        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a web developer who recently graduated from the Fullstack Web
          Development program though Thinkful. After spending ten years as an
          Executive Assistant, I was ready for a new challenge, and coding has
          been the perfect way for me to use the skills I've developed as an EA
          towards learning and growing in a new career path. At my core, I'm a
          problem solver. I love taking complex problems and simplifying them
          into something more logical, organized, and easily digestible. My
          passion for great design means that I aim for pixel-perfect execution,
          and am always thinking about how to make a great layout even better.
          <br />Aside from my love for elegant, clean code, I'm a huge plant and
          animal lover, and most nights you can find me hanging out in my
          apartment with my dog, Boz, and my cat, Theo.

          Nom List is an app that lets users search for restaurants in their

          new restaurants popping up, Nom List allows users to keep track of
          where they've been, where they want to go, and any other list they can
          think up.

        <p>
          Green Thumb is an app that lets users log notes and watering dates on
          their houseplants so that they can track when they need to water the
          plant next. For many plant owners, it can be hard to remember when
          they last watered their various houseplants, or at what frequency a
          certain plant needs watering. Green Thumb is the solution to tracking
          watering dates to be sure that your plant stays happy and healthy.

          produce for, and is then shown a list of items that are available for
          the selected month. After selecting one or more items, the user is
